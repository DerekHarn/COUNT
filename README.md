# COUNT: AI-powered accounting for small businesses

As long-time founders and entrepreneurs, we kept facing the daily challenges of running our ventures. Financial management has always been a significant hurdle for us, just as it has been for many other entrepreneurs and small businesses. 

Amidst the excitement of building our businesses, we couldn't ignore the fact that handling finances often felt like a heavy burden. Countless hours spent wrestling with spreadsheets, late nights deciphering reports, and the constant anxiety of overlooking crucial expenses—it all took its toll. 

Motivated by this shared struggle, we set out on a mission to simplify accounting for fellow business owners. We envisioned a solution that would merge our entrepreneurial spirit with cutting-edge technology. Thus, COUNT was conceived. 

COUNT isn't just another software tool to us—it is our way of making financial management easier for small business owners. We pour our hearts into designing a platform that prioritizes simplicity and clarity, integrating AI-driven insights and automation every step of the way. 

The start of our journey was guided by a deep empathy for the challenges faced by entrepreneurs. We understood that behind every financial statement lay a dream—an ambition fueled by passion and unwavering determination. With this understanding, we work tirelessly to make COUNT more than just a tool; we aim to make it a trusted ally in the pursuit of business success. 

Driven by our passion for helping others, we continuously refine COUNT, listening closely to the needs of our users and making adjustments to better serve the small business community.
